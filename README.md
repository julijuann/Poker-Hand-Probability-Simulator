# Poker-Hand-Probability-Simulator
This project simulates the probabilities of different poker hands in a seven-card game. It uses Python object-oriented programming to model cards, hands, and decks, and runs simulations to estimate the likelihood of various poker hand rankings like flushes, straights, and full houses.
