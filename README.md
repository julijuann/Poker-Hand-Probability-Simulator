# Poker-Hand-Probability-Simulator
This project simulates the probabilities of different poker hands in a seven-card game, demonstrating proficiency in data handling and algorithm implementation. It uses Python object-oriented programming to model cards, hands, and decks, implementing classification methods according to poker rules and running simulations to estimate the likelihood of various hand rankings, such as flushes, straights, and full houses.

## Details
Developed in Jupyter Notebook for a UCLA course from May to June 2024, this project emphasizes data handling and algorithm efficiency.
